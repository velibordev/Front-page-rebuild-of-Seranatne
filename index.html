            <p>I’m Avishka but you can call me Avi.</p>
            <p>A question that I get asked often is - why photography?</p>
            <p>Towards the last few years in school, I became known as the kid that always had a camera by his side.</p>
            <p>What started off as a hobby has grown to be my passion project, for life. I could freeze a moment in time
               for people who are in love, capturing moments of fun, passion and connection. </p>
            <p>I love being challenged by the creative thought process of being a photographer and constantly strive to
               capture beautiful moments that my clients can cherish.</p>
            <p>I always provide the most stress free experience for my clients - whether it be an intimate family shoot
               or a big wedding. I always believe in being present in the moment and enjoying every bit of it.</p>
            <p>A little more about me - I was born and raised in Sri Lanka and moved to Melbourne in 2019. Apart from
               taking photos, I love anything to do with cars, music and food. Cars, because I love driving faster than
               average (on closed roads, away from people, of course), music because I play the drums and love attending
               live shows, and food, because I mean. who doesn't like to eat right?</p>
            <p>Well, that sums a bit about me.I'm looking forward to working with you and freeze those beautiful
               unscripted moments, together</p>
